  <p>My name is Kausthoub Vishnu and I’m a passionate cybersecurity enthusiast and IT professional with a strong foundation built on industry-recognized certifications from CompTIA and Cisco. My hands-on experience ranges from developing coding projects to building and managing a personal homelab environment, where I hone both defensive and offensive security skills.

Through platforms like TryHackMe, I’ve gained practical expertise in real-world cybersecurity scenarios, deepening my understanding of threat detection, vulnerability assessment, and incident response. I’m committed to continuous learning and applying best practices to safeguard systems and networks.

Whether it’s coding, network management, or ethical hacking, I’m driven by curiosity and the challenge of solving complex problems in the cybersecurity landscape. </p>
